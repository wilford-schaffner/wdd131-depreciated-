            <div class="leftCardContent">
                <p>Hey! My name is Wilford Schaffner and I'm a UX/UI Designer living in Prosper, TX. My wife, my daughter and I love
                    spending time together and going outside. I really love the opportunities technology brings into my life and how it
                    helps me serve those I love the most. My interest in UX Design and Graphic Design actually started because of
                    editing some videos and doing some small projects for my church, after that I really wanted to combine my passion
                    for visual design and for serving others so I started my work in UX. I am very detail oriented so I really enjoy
                    solving user pain points by honing in this skill. I love music, my family, and nature, and anything that can make
                    any of those three things more enjoyable.
                </p>
