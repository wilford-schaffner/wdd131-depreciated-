                    <p class="paragraph-style">Hey! My name is Wilford Schaffner and I'm a UX/UI Designer living in Prosper,
                        TX. My wife, my daughter and I love
                        spending time together and going outside. I really love the opportunities technology brings into my
                        life and how it
                        helps me serve those I love the most. My interest in UX Design and Graphic Design actually started
                        because of
                        editing some videos and doing some small projects for my church, after that I really wanted to
                        combine my passion
                        for visual design and for serving others so I started my work in UX. I am very detail oriented so I
                        really enjoy
                        solving user pain points by honing in this skill. I love music, my family, and nature, and anything
                        that can make
                        any of those three things more enjoyable.
