            <p>
                These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In
                the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have
                overcome the world.

                And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our
                fathers call a ball, or directorâ€”or our fathers called it Liahona, which
                is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.
